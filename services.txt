****************************************************************************

I'll help you add these services and create Docker and Kubernetes configurations. Let's break this down into parts:
First, let's create the new services structure:
Apply to AuthControll...
Here's the implementation for each service:
API Gateway Service (block-chain-gateway)
Apply
Apply
Authentication Service (block-chain-auth)
Apply
Analytics Service (block-chain-analytics)
Apply
Audit Service (block-chain-audit)
Apply
Docker Compose file for all services:

Apply
Apply
Add these dependencies to each service's pom.xml:
Apply to AuthControll...
To run the services:
Build each service: mvn clean package
Run with Docker Compose: docker-compose up
Or deploy to Kubernetes:
Apply to AuthControll...
Run
This setup provides:
API Gateway for routing
Authentication with JWT
Analytics for blockchain metrics
Audit logging for all operations
Docker containerization
Kubernetes orchestration
Load balancing and scaling
Each service is independently scalable and maintainable, following microservices best practices.
Make all the services mentioned and make it in such a way that i can be ran succefully using inteliije

I'll help you create a complete setup for all services that can be easily run in IntelliJ IDEA. I'll break down each service with its necessary files and configurations.
API Gateway Service (block-chain-gateway)
Authentication Service (block-chain-auth)
Analytics Service (block-chain-analytics)
Audit Service (block-chain-audit)
POM files for each service
For each service, create a pom.xml with these dependencies:
Similar POM files for other services with appropriate dependencies.
To run in IntelliJ:
Import each service as a separate module
Make sure MongoDB is running locally
Run each application in this order:
Gateway (port 8080)
Auth (port 8081)
Analytics (port 8082)
Audit (port 8084)
You can create separate Run Configurations in IntelliJ for each service. Right-click on each Application class and select "Run".
This setup provides a complete microservices architecture that can be easily run and debugged in IntelliJ IDEA.
and how will my endpoints looks give all endpoints

I'll list all the endpoints for each service in your microservices architecture:
API Gateway (Port: 8080)
All requests go through the gateway with base URL: http://localhost:8080
Authentication Service (Port: 8081)
Base URL through gateway: http://localhost:8080/auth
Apply to AuthControll...
Analytics Service (Port: 8082)
Base URL through gateway: http://localhost:8080/analytics
Apply to AuthControll...
Audit Service (Port: 8084)
Base URL through gateway: http://localhost:8080/audit
Apply to AuthControll...
Existing Block-Chain Data Retrieve Service (Port: 8083)
Base URL through gateway: http://localhost:8080/documents
Apply to AuthControll...
Example Usage:
Register a new user:
Apply to AuthControll...
Run
Login:
Apply to AuthControll...
Run
Get blockchain metrics:
Apply to AuthControll...
Run
Log an audit event:
Apply to AuthControll...
Run
Retrieve blockchain documents:
Apply to AuthControll...
Run
All these endpoints are:
Protected by JWT authentication (except login/register)
Routed through the API Gateway
Logged by the Audit Service
Monitored by the Analytics Service
The API Gateway handles:
Request routing
Authentication verification
Load balancing
Request logging
Each service maintains its own MongoDB collection:
auth_db.users
analytics_db.metrics
audit_db.audit_events
secure_db.documents
This provides a complete API structure for your blockchain microservices architecture.
None of the above service is working make it so that it can work

block-chain-auth i have made a new folder do the changes direcylt there

Complete Setup for block-chain-auth in Your New Folder
I'll provide all the files you need to create in your new folder for the block-chain-auth service. Follow these instructions to set up the complete service.
1. Create the following file structure:
Apply to AuthControll...
2. Now copy these file contents into each file:

Instructions to Setup and Run:
Create all the files above in the correct directory structure in your new folder.
Make sure you have Maven installed on your system to build the project.
Open the project in IntelliJ:
Open IntelliJ IDEA
Click "Open" and select the "block-chain-auth" folder
IntelliJ should recognize it as a Maven project
Let IntelliJ download all the dependencies specified in the pom.xml file.
Make sure MongoDB is running:
Apply to AuthControll...
Run
Or if you have MongoDB installed locally, ensure it's running on port 27017.
Run the application:
Find the AuthApplication.java file in the project structure
Right-click on it and select "Run 'AuthApplication.main()'"
Or use the green play button in the gutter
Test the API:
Use Postman or any HTTP client to test the endpoints:
Register a new user: POST http://localhost:8081/auth/register
Login: POST http://localhost:8081/auth/login
This completes the setup for the block-chain-auth service. The service provides JWT authentication, user registration, and secure password handling with a MongoDB backend.
@block-chain-auth do all the changes here 

Implementing Authentication Service in Your Existing Structure
I'll implement the full authentication service in your existing block-chain-auth folder. Here are the files you need to create and modify:
1. Update pom.xml
8 hidden lines
5 hidden lines
11 hidden lines
2. Create Main Application Class
3. Create Application Properties
4. Create Model Classes
5. Create Repository Classes
6. Create Security Configuration and Components
7. Create Service Classes
8. Create Controller
9. Create DTOs
10. Create Exception Classes
Running the Service
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
Make sure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017
Run the AuthApplication.java as a Spring Boot application
Test with the following endpoints:
Register a user:
Apply to AuthControll...
Login:
Apply to AuthControll...
The service will return a JWT token that can be used for authentication in other services.
java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport does not have member field 'com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree qualid'

Resolving the JCTree$JCImport Error in Your Authentication Service
This error is related to an incompatibility between Lombok and your Java compiler version. The error occurs specifically when the annotation processor tries to access fields that don't exist in your current JDK version.
Solution Options
Option 1: Update Lombok Version
Add a specific, newer version of Lombok to your pom.xml that's compatible with your Java version:
Option 2: Check Java Compiler Version
Ensure your Java compiler version matches your JDK version. Add this to your pom.xml under the <build> section:
Option 3: Exclude Problematic Dependencies
If you have Spring Boot DevTools enabled, it can sometimes cause conflicts:
Option 4: Use the Latest Spring Boot Version
Since you're using Spring Boot, make sure the parent version is compatible with your JDK:
Instructions for Fixing
Try implementing Option 1 first (update Lombok version)
If that doesn't work, implement Option 2 (specify compiler version)
Clean and rebuild your project:
Apply to AuthControll...
Restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes
If you're using the IntelliJ Lombok plugin, make sure it's updated to the latest version
These changes should resolve the error related to Lombok's annotation processor having compatibility issues with your Java compiler. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport does not have member field 'com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree qualid'

i have to run @BlockChainAuthApplication.java right?

Fixing the JCTree$JCImport Error and Running Your Authentication Service
Yes, you need to run BlockChainAuthApplication.java as the main class to start your authentication service. However, you're encountering a Lombok-related error that needs to be fixed first.
The Issue
The error java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport does not have member field 'com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree qualid' is occurring because there's a compatibility issue between Lombok, your JDK version, and the compiler. I see you've already implemented several fixes in your pom.xml, but the issue persists.
Additional Solutions to Try
Completely remove Lombok and use plain Java
This is the most straightforward approach to fix this issue:
Remove the Lombok dependency from your pom.xml
Replace @Data, @AllArgsConstructor, etc. with plain Java code (getters, setters, constructors)
Try Lombok delombok
Use Lombok's delombok feature to convert your Lombok-annotated code to plain Java:
Apply to AuthControll...
Check your actual JDK version being used
Make sure that your IDE is using Java 11 for both compilation and runtime:
In IntelliJ, go to File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Project
Ensure SDK is set to Java 11
Also check Module settings to ensure the Language Level is set to 11
Clean IntelliJ caches
Close IntelliJ
Delete the .idea folder and IntelliJ cache folders
Reimport the project
Remove and reinstall Lombok IntelliJ plugin
Go to File > Settings > Plugins
Find Lombok plugin
Uninstall it, restart IntelliJ, and reinstall it
Create annotation-only compliant DTOs
For classes like your DTOs, try using only standard Java annotations and not Lombok:
Apply to AuthControll...
Steps to Run Your Application
Once you've fixed the Lombok issue:
Make sure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017
Right-click on BlockChainAuthApplication.java in IntelliJ
Select "Run 'BlockChainAuthApplication'"
The application should start on port 8081
Test with API calls to register and login endpoints
Remember that if you've set up your code as suggested in my previous message, your package structure might not match BlockChainAuthApplication.java. You may need to update your code to use that as the main class, or update the main class to match your package structure.
In my other services lombok is working see that and refer to it

Aligning Auth Service Lombok Configuration with Your Working Services
Since Lombok is working in your other services but causing issues in the auth service, let's align the configurations to make them consistent. Here are the key areas to check and fix:
1. Package Structure Alignment
Your BlockChainAuthApplication.java is in package com.example, but the code I provided uses com.example.auth. You need to either:
Move your auth classes to match the existing package structure:
Apply to AuthControll...
Or create a subpackage structure but ensure the main application can scan it:
Apply to AuthControll...
2. Lombok Version Consistency
Ensure the Lombok version in auth service matches your working services:
Apply to AuthControll...
3. Java/Maven Compiler Configuration
Make sure compiler configurations match across services:
Apply to AuthControll...
4. Spring Boot Parent Version
Ensure the Spring Boot parent version matches your working services:
Apply to AuthControll...
5. Simplify Lombok Usage Initially
Start with minimal Lombok usage to get things working:
Apply to AuthControll...
6. IDE Configuration
Ensure IntelliJ is configured the same way for all services:
Same JDK version
Same Lombok plugin version
Same compiler settings
Enable annotation processing in IntelliJ (Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors)
7. Alternative Approach - Use Library from Working Services
If nothing else works, examine how you're using Lombok in your working services and copy that exact approach. If you're using specific annotations there but not others, stick to the same pattern.
By aligning the Auth service configuration with your working services, Lombok should work properly and you should be able to run BlockChainAuthApplication.java without encountering the JCTree error.
java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport does not have member field 'com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree qualid' solvw it at once use whatever way you want to use use seeters and getters manually if needed

Direct Solution: Remove Lombok and Use Manual Java Code
To immediately solve the java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport does not have member field 'com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree qualid' error, I'll provide versions of all model/DTO classes with manual getters and setters instead of Lombok annotations.
1. First, remove Lombok from pom.xml:
2. Replace model classes with non-Lombok versions:
User.java
LoginRequest.java
RegisterRequest.java
JwtResponse.java
MessageResponse.java
3. Update your AuthService class to remove @Data references
4. Update package structure to match main class
Since your main class is com.example.BlockChainAuthApplication.java, ensure your model classes match this structure.
Two options:
Move all the auth-specific code to sub-packages of com.example:
Apply to AuthControll...
Update your main application class to scan sub-packages:
5. Build and Run
With Lombok removed and all classes using standard Java getters/setters, the compilation error should be resolved. Run your application:
Apply to AuthControll...
Or simply run the BlockChainAuthApplication.java main class from IntelliJ.
This solution completely eliminates the dependency on Lombok annotation processing, which should resolve the JCTree$JCImport error by avoiding the annotation processing stage entirely.
do all the changes again i reverted it by mistake

Implementing Authentication Service Again
Looking at your files, I can see you've already implemented most of the needed changes. Let's fix remaining issues to make your auth service work properly:
1. First, let's update the pom.xml to remove Lombok completely:
Key changes:
Removed Lombok from annotation processor paths
Removed Lombok exclusion from boot-maven-plugin
2. Create the JwtTokenProvider class:
3. Create the JwtAuthenticationFilter:
4. Create the JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint:
5. Create SecurityConfig:
6. Create UserRepository:
7. Create UserDetailsServiceImpl:
continue

Let me continue implementing the remaining components for your authentication service:
8. Create the User model class:
9. Create the DTO classes:
10. Create exception classes:
11. Create AuthService:
12. Create AuthController:
13. Create application.properties:
14. Update main application class:
That completes all necessary files for your authentication service. To run it:
Make sure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017
Run BlockChainAuthApplication from IntelliJ
Test with these endpoints:
Register User:
Apply to AuthControll...
Login:
Apply to AuthControll...
The service will return a JWT token that can be used for authentication with your other microservices.

java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport does not have member field 'com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree qualid' agin this error solve it like earlier

Solution for JCTree$JCImport Error
This error occurs due to a compatibility issue between Lombok and your specific JDK version. Just like before, the most reliable fix is to completely remove Lombok and use standard Java code instead.
Step 1: Remove Lombok from pom.xml
Apply to AuthControll...
Step 2: Create plain Java model/DTO classes instead of using Lombok annotations
For example, replace @Data or other Lombok annotations with regular Java getters, setters, and constructors:
Apply to AuthControll...
Step 3: Make similar changes to all classes using Lombok annotations
Go through all your classes that use Lombok annotations like:
@Data
@Getter
@Setter
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode
@Builder
@Slf4j
Replace them with their standard Java equivalents.
Step 4: Clean and rebuild your project
Apply to AuthControll...
Run
Step 5: Restart IntelliJ and reload the project
This ensures that all caches are cleared and the updated configuration is loaded properly.
This approach completely eliminates the dependency on Lombok's annotation processing, which will resolve the JCTree$JCImport error by avoiding the annotation processing stage entirely.
fo it

Removing Lombok to Fix JCTree$JCImport Error
Here's how to fix the error by removing Lombok:
1. Update pom.xml to remove Lombok
2. Replace Lombok annotations in all models with standard Java code
User.java (updated without Lombok)
LoginRequest.java (updated without Lombok)
RegisterRequest.java (updated without Lombok)
JwtResponse.java (updated without Lombok)
MessageResponse.java (updated without Lombok)
3. After making these changes:
Run mvn clean install from the command line
Restart your IDE
Run the application using BlockChainAuthApplication.java
This approach completely removes the dependency on Lombok and should resolve the JCTree$JCImport error by using standard Java code instead of annotation processing.
java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport does not have member field 'com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree qualid' same eror is there still

Comprehensive Solution for JCTree$JCImport Error
I see your models already have standard Java code (without Lombok), but the error persists. This means the issue might be coming from another source. Here's a comprehensive approach to fix it:
1. Verify All Java Files Are Free of Lombok
Make sure all your classes - not just the ones you shared - are free of Lombok annotations. Look for:
@Data
@Getter/@Setter
@AllArgsConstructor/@NoArgsConstructor
@Builder
@Slf4j
2. Check IntelliJ Plugins and Settings
Disable the Lombok Plugin in IntelliJ:
Go to File → Settings → Plugins
Find "Lombok" and disable/uninstall it
Restart IntelliJ
Clear IntelliJ caches:
File → Invalidate Caches / Restart
Select "Invalidate and Restart"
3. Update Maven Compiler Plugin Configuration
Modify your maven-compiler-plugin to explicitly disable annotation processing:
4. Fix Package Structure Issue
Ensure your main application can scan all packages:
5. Clean Project Completely
Delete these directories:
target/
.idea/
Any other generated directories
Run a complete Maven clean:
Apply to AuthControll...
Rebuild from scratch:
Apply to AuthControll...
6. Check for Hidden Dependencies
Look for any hidden dependencies that might bring in annotation processors:
Apply to AuthControll...
Check for any suspicious entries and exclude them if necessary.
7. Try Using JDK 11 Exactly
The error might be related to JDK version compatibility. Use exactly JDK 11 (not newer):
Make sure you have JDK 11 installed
In IntelliJ: File → Project Structure → Project → SDK → Select JDK 11

8. As a Last Resort
If nothing else works, create a new project from scratch and copy just the code files (not the build or configuration files) to eliminate any hidden configuration issues.
By following these steps comprehensively, we should be able to eliminate the JCTree$JCImport error regardless of its origin.

Description:

The bean 'userRepository', defined in com.example.auth.repository.UserRepository defined in @EnableMongoRepositories declared on MongoRepositoriesRegistrar.EnableMongoRepositoriesConfiguration, could not be registered. A bean with that name has already been defined in com.example.auth.repository.UserRepository defined in @EnableMongoRepositories declared on MongoRepositoriesRegistrar.EnableMongoRepositoriesConfiguration and overriding is disabled.

Action:

Consider renaming one of the beans or enabling overriding by setting spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true

Fix for Duplicate Bean Definition Error
This is a different error than your previous one. Now we're dealing with a duplicate bean definition problem. The error message indicates that your application has two repositories named userRepository being registered.
The Fix:
Option 1: Add Bean Override Setting
Add this property to your application.properties file:
This tells Spring to allow overriding of bean definitions, which resolves this specific error.
Option 2: Fix Package Structure Issues
The error is likely caused by overlapping component scanning. You have:
Apply to AuthControll...
This could cause duplicate scanning since com.example already includes com.example.auth. There are two ways to fix this:
Remove the redundant scanning:
OR, make sure all your repositories are in just one package structure. For example, if you have repositories in both com.example and com.example.auth, consolidate them into one location.
Option 3: Check for Duplicate Repository Interfaces
You might have accidentally created two UserRepository interfaces. Search your project for all files named UserRepository.java and make sure there's only one.
Option 4: Disable DevTools
Spring Boot DevTools can sometimes cause this issue. You can temporarily disable it by commenting it out in your pom.xml:
5 hidden lines
Additional Note:
You're running with Java 23.0.2, which is very new and may have compatibility issues with Spring Boot 2.7.x. Consider using Java 11 or Java 17 which are better supported by Spring Boot 2.7.x.
In your IntelliJ IDE settings, make sure you're using Java 11 for both compilation and runtime to avoid potential compatibility issues.
tell me about the endpoint snow

Authentication Service Endpoints
Now that you've added the appropriate configuration (allowing bean definition overriding and commenting out DevTools), your authentication service should have the following endpoints:
Authentication Endpoints
1. User Registration
Apply to AuthControll...
Description: Register a new user in the system
Request Body:
Apply to AuthControll...
Response:
Apply to AuthControll...
2. User Login
Apply to AuthControll...
Description: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT token
Request Body:
Apply to AuthControll...
Response:
Apply to AuthControll...
Testing the Endpoints
You can test these endpoints using tools like Postman, cURL, or any HTTP client:
First, register a user:
Apply to AuthControll...
Then login to get a token:
Apply to AuthControll...
Use the returned token in subsequent requests to other services by including it in the Authorization header:
Apply to AuthControll...
Security Notes
All endpoints except /auth/register and /auth/login require authentication
The JWT token expires after 24 hours (86400000 ms as configured)
User passwords are stored encrypted using BCrypt
The authentication service validates tokens for all other microservices
These endpoints form the security foundation for your blockchain microservices architecture, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources across your system.
